I am a visiting assistant professor of Actuarial Science at Drake University and a Mathematics Ph.D. candidate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 

Prior to my doctoral study, I worked as a research assistant at the Critical Infrastructure Resilience Institute (CIRI) and had three years of research experience in topics related to cyber risk and cyber insurance. During my doctoral program, I worked on several projects as a research assistant or a PI funded by the Society of Actuaries, the Fundaci√≥n MAPFRE, and Cisco.

I published peer-reviewed academic papers about a variety of aspects of cyber risk in actuarial science, engineering, and law review journals, such as Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance: Issues and Practice, IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, and Connecticut Insurance Law Journal.
