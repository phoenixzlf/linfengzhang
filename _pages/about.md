I am an assistant professor of Actuarial Science at the Ohio State University. I earned my Ph.D. degree in Mathematics with the concentration in Actuarial Science and Risk Analytics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of <a href="https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~rfeng/">Dr. Runhuan Feng</a> and <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/wingfungalfredchong/home">Dr. Wing Fung (Alfred) Chong</a>. 

I worked at the Drake University, Iowa, as a visiting assistant professor of Actuarial Science during my last year of PhD study from Fall 2022 to Summer 2023. 

Prior to my doctoral study, I worked as a research assistant at the Critical Infrastructure Resilience Institute and had three years of research experience in topics related to cyber risk and cyber insurance. During my doctoral program, I worked on several projects as a research assistant or a PI funded by the Society of Actuaries, the Fundaci√≥n MAPFRE, and Cisco.

I published peer-reviewed academic papers about a variety of aspects of cyber risk in actuarial science, engineering, and law review journals, such as Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance: Issues and Practice, IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, and Connecticut Insurance Law Journal. I am also working on other emerging topics in the field of actuarial science and risk management, such as pandemic risk and privacy risk.
